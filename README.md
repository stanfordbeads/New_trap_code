# The repository for work done with and on the new trap
### Here we store all stolen code from the old trap and also put in newly developed stuff

If you want to get started with GitHub there are a few introductional videos I randomly found on YouTube:

First of all I would recommend to create and use your own GitHub account rather than the general account (stanfordbeads). The general procedere can be summarized as following:

1a. Clone the repository on your account at the beads-dataserver2 (command here) 

1b. Clone the repository to your own computer [You will see, this will not be necessary as you should be able to access the jupyterhub at any time from everywhere]

2. Writing code? Good! But check first if already exists (Chas and Alex have written a lot of stuff). If you are not sure, better ask then do a job twice. 

3. You wrote new code? Add it to the git repository by pushing it (commands here)

4. You improved existing code? Why not going for a pull request in order to get it cross checked (commands here)

5. In all cases, comment(!) your code as well as your changes. Write more then less of descriptive text. Always a good idea. Always.
