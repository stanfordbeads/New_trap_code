# The repository for work done with and on the new trap
### Here we store all stolen code from the old trap and also put in newly developed stuff

If you want to get started with GitHub there are a few introductional videos I randomly found on YouTube:

First of all I would recommend to create and use your own GitHub account rather than the general account (stanfordbeads). The general procedere can be summarized as following:

1a. Clone the repository on your account at the beads-dataserver2 

1b. Clone the repository to your own computer [You will see, this will not be necessary as you should be able to access the jupyterhub at any time from everywhere]

2. Writing code? Good! But check first if already exists (Chas and AlexR have written a lot of stuff). If you are not sure, better ask to not do a job twice. 

3. You wrote new code? Add it to the git repository by pushing it.

4. You improved existing code? Why not going for a pull request in order to get it cross checked.

5. In all cases, comment(!) your code as well as your changes. Write more than less of descriptive text. Always a good idea. Always.

Accessing the JupyterHub

Data saving
In our meeting on 05/08/2019 we decided to do the following steps:

Save data in the same way as in the old trap. This includes two files - one for the data stream from the FPGA and one from the DAQ(mainly the electrode data). The data should be saved according to its date to a folder. Within the date folder a substrcture will be created automatically given on what ever measurment was taken. The list includes:
Data
- without radial feedback at different heights
- with radial feedback
- after pump down
- coarse charging data
- diagonalization data
- mass measurement
- fine discharging data
- height finding data
- measurement of interest
